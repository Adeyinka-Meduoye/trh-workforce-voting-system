    <h2>Why This Initiative Matters</h2>
    <p>
      The TRH Workforce Team Member of the Month initiative celebrates individuals 
      who consistently embody the core values - honor, excellence, accountability, results, and trust
      of the TRH Ministries Global in their service. As the Senate President and Workforce Council 
      Director, the purpose of this initiative is to nurture a culture of honour, teamwork, and 
      exceptional commitment across every organisation and department of TRH Global.
    </p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Each organisation runs a monthly internal team-member voting process.</li>
      <li>Winners from each organisation automatically advance to a final workforce-wide selection.</li>
      <li>The Workforce Team Member of the Month selected by the Workforce Recognition Committee is honoured, celebrated, and showcased globally.</li>
    </ul>
