# Why This Initiative Matters
The TRH Workforce Team Member of the Month initiative celebrates individuals who consistently embody the core values - honor, excellence, accountability, results, and trust of the TRH Ministries Global in their service. As the Senate President and Workforce Council Director, the purpose of this initiative is to nurture a culture of honour, teamwork, and exceptional commitment across every organisation and department of TRH Global.

# How It Works
Each organisation runs a monthly internal team-member voting process.
Winners from each organisation automatically advance to a final workforce-wide selection.
The Workforce Team Member of the Month selected by the Workforce Recognition Committee is honoured, celebrated, and showcased globally.
